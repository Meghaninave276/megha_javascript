## 🛠 Technologies Used:

#### HTML5

#### CSS3

#### Bootstrap 5 (CDN)

#### JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 📌 Validation Logic:

#### If both fields are empty → shows "enter the both fields"

#### If both email and password are valid → shows "Email and Password are valid"

#### If both are invalid → shows "Email and Password are invalid"

#### If only email is invalid → shows "Email is invalid"

#### If only password is invalid → shows "Password is invalid"

## 📂 Files:

#### index.html – main file containing structure and styling

#### script.js – JavaScript logic for validation (external or embedded)
